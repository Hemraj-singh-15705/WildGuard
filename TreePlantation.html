          <div class="col-4">Tree plantation (also known as forest plantation, timber plantation, or tree farm) involves intentionally planting trees for specific purposes. These purposes can range from high-volume wood production to land reclamation and even landscaping</div>
          <div class="col-4">
            Imagine rows of saplings standing tall, like a well-organized green army, ready to battle climate change and provide all sorts of goodies for us humans. 🌱

          <h1 class="plant"> WHY DO WE PLANT TREES</h1>
          <div class="col-4"><b>Wood Production: </b><br>One of the main reasons for tree plantations is to produce wood efficiently. Instead of waiting around for centuries (like natural forests do), plantations grow trees quickly. Think of it as the “fast food” version of forestry</div>
          <div class="col-4">
            <b>Monoculture Forests:</b><br> In these plantations, you’ll often find a single type of tree—kind of like a tree-exclusive party. They’re all about that one tree species, whether it’s eucalyptus, pine, or oak

        <h1 class="plant"> WHY SHOULD WE  CARE</h1>
        <div class="col-4"><b>Oxygen Factory:</b><br> Trees are like the Earth’s lung buddies. They inhale carbon dioxide (the stuff we exhale) and exhale oxygen (the stuff we need to live). So, basically, they’re our green oxygen factories. 🌬️</div>
        <div class="col-4">
         <b>Food Chain Heroes:</b><br> Trees are the base of the food chain. They provide fresh fruits, nuts, and other goodies for all living creatures. Without them, we’d be hangry and snackless! 🍎🐿️
